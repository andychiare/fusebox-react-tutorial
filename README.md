# FuseBox configuration for a React application

This is a very basic React application project similar to the one created by `create-react-app` using [FuseBox](https://fuse-box.org) as its building system. The project is described in the article [Introducing FuseBox, an alternative to Webpack](https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-fusebox-an-alternative-to-webpack/).

Before building the application, run the following command in the root folder:

```shell
npm install
```

In order to build the development code of the application and start the integrated web server, run the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

In order to build the production ready code, run the following command:

```shell
npm run dist
```
